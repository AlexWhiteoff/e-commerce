# Woodmade

**Woodmade** is an e-commerce project offering a variety of premium-quality wooden products for every taste. The project was created not for commercial use but solely for the purpose of developing web development skills and self-improvement.

This is one of the first large-scale, full-fledged projects developed using modern programming approaches.

## Project Features

- **Project Type:** Educational e-commerce application.
- **Architecture Pattern:** MVC (Model-View-Controller).
- **CMS System:** Custom-built.
- **Design Patterns:** Utilization of modern design approaches.
- **Database:** MySQL.
- **Backend:** PHP version 7.4.
- **Frontend:** HTML, SCSS, JavaScript.

## Project Goals

1. Improve web development skills.
2. Practice building e-commerce applications.
3. Implement a custom CMS system and apply the MVC pattern.
4. Enhance understanding of design patterns and their real-world applications.

## Design & Inspiration

While creating the idea and design of the project, I was inspired by:

- [Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/file/k8i3wwEPgK0LHP1WGmldF9/GROVEMADE?node-id=0%3A1).
- [Grovemade Website](https://grovemade.com/).

All design elements in the project were adapted and modified according to my goals and requirements. Textures, product images, and other materials were not directly taken from these resources.

## Project Setup

### Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or later.
- Web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx).
- MySQL server.
- Node.js (for SCSS compilation if needed).

### Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlexWhiteoff/E-commerce.git
   ```

2. Set up the database:

   - Import the `database.sql` file, located in the root directory, into your MySQL database.

3. Configure the project in `config/config.php`:

   - Add database access information (server, user, password, database name).

4. Start the web server and open the project in a browser at the appropriate address (e.g., `http://woodmade.local/`).
